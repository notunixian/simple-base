## Archival Note
**This project has been archived**. To put it simply, there are many other better ways to mod VRChat and IL2CPP games in general. Google is your friend, and you can find anything you want about modding IL2CPP games within C/C++. I hope you all have a fun time modding the game (even during the times of EAC) and can't wait to see what people in this community will create.
